Simple one shot modal
==============
Use class 'modal-closer' in the HTML to display the 'close' link in the top right of the modal container, remove class if not needed!
<br>The CSS handles the content/position etc for the 'close' and the fade animation.
<br>The escape key also closes the modal.
<br>You'll need to add prefixes for the animation, this demo only includes -webkit-.
<br>JS and CSS files are 1k un-minified.
